# Decision_Tree_Algorithm

**About the Project**
<br>
    This Decision Tree Algorithm was one of the projects completed during my course with Internshala on Machine Learning using Python. This project uses actual data gathered and uses it to analyse and predict whether a customer would be granted a loan or not depending on various parameters.

**About the Machine Learning Model**
<br>
   Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset. It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions. It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure. Decision tree is mainly used over datasets for two reasons. Namely, Decision Trees usually mimic human thinking ability while making a decision, so it is easy to understand. The logic behind the decision tree can be easily understood because it shows a tree-like structure. The Following decision tree algorithm “decides” whether a customer will receive a loan from the bank or not.
